# Importing create_geospatial_analyzer issue in Python (2025-06-02 11:10:12)

_**User**_

@workspace i am trying to import create_geospatial_analyzer into this test file, but i keep coming up with No module found. even when i make changes. this is the output of my print statement print(sys.path) in line 9

Your `sys.path` does **not** include the `` directory, which is why Python cannot find `src.utils.factory`.  
You are currently adding the project root (two levels up) to `sys.path`, but you need to add the `` directory specifically.

**Fix:**  
Add the following line before your imports from ``:

````python
# ...existing code...
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'src')))
# ...existing code...
````

This will add the `` directory to your `sys.path`, allowing imports like:

```python
from utils.factory import create_geospatial_analyzer
```

Or, if you want to keep the `src.` prefix:

```python
from src.utils.factory import create_geospatial_analyzer
```

**Summary:**  
- Add `` to `sys.path` as shown above.
- Restart your test or Python process after making this change.

You can find your test file here: `test_geospatial_analyzer.py`  
And the factory import target here: `factory.py`

the problem is that i am also trying to access the configs directory

---

_**Assistant**_

To import both `src.utils.factory` and `configs.paths`, you need both the `` directory and the project root (which contains ``) in your `sys.path`.

**Solution:**  
Add both paths to `sys.path` before your imports:

````python
import sys
import os

# Add the src directory to the Python path
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'src')))
# Add the project root (one level up) to the Python path for configs
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))

import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point

from src.utils.factory import create_geospatial_analyzer
from configs.paths import SAMPLE_REGION_PATH
# ...existing code...
````

**Explanation:**
- `sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'src')))` lets you import from ``.
- `sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))` lets you import from ``.

**Order matters:**  
Add these lines before any imports from `` or ``.

This will resolve your import errors for both modules.

for my import paths, i am getting reference before assignment error when i ultimately call this function. care to explain?

---

_**Assistant**_

You are getting a "referenced before assignment" error because you are **reassigning** the module-level variables `BUILDINGS_PATH`, `MINIGRIDS_PATH`, etc. inside your function.  
When you assign to a variable inside a function, Python treats it as a **local variable** unless you explicitly declare it as `global`.  
But you should **not** reassign imported module-level constants like this.

**What's happening:**
```python
def create_geospatial_analyzer(bpath=None, ...):
    if bpath is not None:
        BUILDINGS_PATH = ...  # This is now a local variable!
    # ...
    return GeospatialAnalyzer(
        buildings_path=BUILDINGS_PATH,  # This will fail if bpath is None!
        ...
    )
```
If `bpath` is `None`, then the local `BUILDINGS_PATH` is never set, and Python tries to use the global one, but because you assigned to it locally, Python expects a local variable and throws an error.

---

## **How to Fix**

**Option 1: Use local variables for overrides**
```python
def create_geospatial_analyzer(bpath=None, mpath=None, tpath=None, ppath=None):
    buildings_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../../data/" + bpath) if bpath else BUILDINGS_PATH
    minigrids_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../../data/" + mpath) if mpath else MINIGRIDS_PATH
    tile_stats_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../../data/" + tpath) if tpath else TILE_STATS_PATH
    plain_tiles_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../../data/" + ppath) if ppath else PLAIN_TILES_PATH

    return GeospatialAnalyzer(
        buildings_path=buildings_path,
        minigrids_path=minigrids_path,
        tile_stats_path=tile_stats_path,
        plain_tiles_path=plain_tiles_path
    )
```

**Option 2: Use `global` (not recommended here)**
You could declare `global BUILDINGS_PATH` etc., but this is not recommended for this use case.

---

**Summary:**  
- Do **not** reassign imported constants inside a function.
- Use new local variable names for the paths you want to pass to your class.

This will fix your "referenced before assignment" error.

what's the best way to move this workspace to a new directory?

---

_**Assistant**_

To move your workspace to a new directory **and keep your code working**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Copy the Entire Project Folder**

Use Finder or the terminal to copy the whole project folder (including ``, ``, ``, ``, etc.) to the new location.

**Terminal example:**
```bash
cp -r "/old/path/to/suntrace-multimodal" "/new/path/to/suntrace-multimodal"
```

---

### 2. **Update Any Hardcoded Paths**

- If you have any **hardcoded absolute paths** in your code or config files (e.g., `/Users/Imran/...`), update them to use **relative paths** or update them to the new location.
- Your code already uses relative paths for most data and imports, which is good.

---

### 3. **Check and Update Environment Variables (if any)**

- If you use environment variables for paths, update them to point to the new directory.

---

### 4. **Open the New Directory in VS Code**

- Open VS Code.
- Use `File > Open...` and select the new project directory.

---

### 5. **Test Your Imports**

- Run your tests or scripts to ensure imports like `from configs.paths import ...` and `from utils.factory import ...` still work.
- If you see import errors, check your `sys.path` manipulations and adjust if your directory structure has changed.

---

### 6. **Update Any External References**

- If you have scripts, notebooks, or deployment configs outside the project that reference the old path, update them to the new path.

---

### 7. **(Optional) Remove the Old Directory**

Once you confirm everything works, you can delete the old directory to avoid confusion.

---

**Summary:**  
- Use relative paths in your code as much as possible.
- Update any absolute paths or environment variables.
- Test your code after moving.

This approach will ensure your workspace remains portable and functional after moving.
